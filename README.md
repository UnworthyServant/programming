你看父赐给我们是何等的慈爱，使我们得称为　神的儿女；我们也真是他的儿女。世人所以不认识我们，是因未曾认识他。 亲爱的 弟兄 啊，我们现在是　神的儿女，将来如何，还未显明；但我们知道，主若显现，我们必要像他，因为必得见他的真体。 约翰一书 3:1‭-‬2  
See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is. 1 John 3:1‭-‬2
